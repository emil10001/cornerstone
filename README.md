CURRENTLY UNTESTED! What's contained is an initial update for JellyBean, but it has not been tested at all!

This is intended to be an update for CM10 on an Asus TF700T.

All changes should be marked with a comment containing 'Onskreen'. 

These files should be merged with the up-to-date versions in the android system.
